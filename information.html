<h4>&dagger;2021 REAPER RECIPES CO-OP</h4>
<p><q>The first ever emotionally intellectual recipe co-op!</q></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>No star ratings. No social media connectivity. Just recipes that youâ€™ll have to try. Good old recipes by you and me.
<br><br>
Reaper Recipes is an ongoing online cookbook co-op. Anyone can join the co-op by submitting a recipe to share with the world using the button on the upper left of this page. So please, contribute to this evergrowing collection of recipes personal and dear. For copyright reasons, please make sure your recipe is at least somewhat original, though credited adaptations are always welcome. When sharing a recipe, please be as thorough as you can in your description and instructions. All recipes are moderated by Amanda Perkins and Michael Quednau.
